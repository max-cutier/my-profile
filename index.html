			  I'm originally from France, born in Paris, with pretty much my whole family living in the country. However, I was raised from in the United States after my parents moved to NY when I was 2. I grew up in Westchester County, about 45 minutes north of NYC in a small rural town called Armonk. This gives me the luxury of dual-nationality between these two great countries. From this international background, I speak French and English fluently; Spanish proficiently, and am learning German.

        I am a young student who loves to travel. I am very lucky to have been able to live a transatlantic flight between Europe and America. I have always appreciated experiencing new places and new cultures. These three pictures are from some of my all-time favorite memories from past trips.
